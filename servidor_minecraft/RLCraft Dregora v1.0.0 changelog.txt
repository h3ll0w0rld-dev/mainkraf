After being over 2 years in the makings using RLCraft as it's foundation RLCraft Dregora is finally here to involve you with a world of creativity and wonder for which we have to thank those contributed to the effort. This includes those who helped test, create and modified elements now found in the complete pack we call RLCraft Dregora and beyond that the community that surrounds it since it's origins by which I mean those who helped either RLCraft or Dregora in the early days.

We are really looking forward to hearing about your experiences hoping the accumulated experience will be one to remember for years to come and with that I think I have said enough as true laughter and fun does not lay with this scribble of text but what waits ahead!
