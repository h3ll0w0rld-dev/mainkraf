RLCraft Dregora v1.0.1 HOTFIX (painful 5AM headache edition):

- Reworked many loottables that effect 
- Fixed SRParasites dealing more damage in Overworld instead of less (oops math, blame Eagle 3am brain)
- Remoced accidental I&F Ghost spawners
- Fixed Killer Rabbits not killing you (removed from EpicSeige AI as this was breaking them)
- Lowered wandering Cyclops spawn chance
- Lowered chance for I&F Trolls to spawn outside
- Restricted I&F Trolls spawning outside to specific biomes only (such as roofed forests with cover from sunlight)
- Added Herobrine hat to emissive textures for eye glowing support of spookyness
